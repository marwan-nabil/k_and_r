# k and r
solved exercises, variations of code segments and programs,   inspired by the book "the c programming language".

## [Chapter 1](./chapter_1)
+ comments_remover.c : removes all c-style comments from input files.  
+ detab.c : replaces all tabs with 4 spaces.  
+ entab.c : replaces all 4 consecutive spaces with a tab.  
+ fold_lines.c : folds long input lines into limited length lines.  
+ program_checker.c : checks a program for mismatched parens syntax errors.  



## [Chapter 2](./chapter_2)
+ bit_play.c : bit manipulation, masking, replacement, counting functions.
+ const_experiments.c : experimenting with constants.  
+ garbage_explorer.c : looking at uninitialized local variables and pointers.
+ htoi.c : converting a hex number string into a decimal.
+ type_limits.c : experimenting with type limits manually or with <limits.h>.


## [Chapter 5](./chapter_5)
+ comparisons.c : many comparison functions, used in sorting algorithms (pointed to).
+ quick_sort.c : generic quick sort algorithm with auxiliary functions like swap(), compare() is pointed to by quick_sort().  
+ quick_sort_tests.c : unit tests for comparison and sorting funtions.
